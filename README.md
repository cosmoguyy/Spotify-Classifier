hey Raunak Raj this side , Swinging my legs in Engineering Physics Department. The project says it all , I do listen to music and am currently learning flute (Haven't even begun actually Lmaoo) and I love watching movies. I am actually really excited to learn a lot.

My Repo includes some of the codes i have been doing to learn basic syntax for assignment usage.

The project revolves around the classification of music using music key audio features. Dataset from Spotify Audio Features is used to classify genre/mood and classify new song their mood and genre.
