1) Odd or even Detector

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if num % 2 == 0:
    print("That is Even number")
else:
    print("That is Odd number")


2) Interest Calculator

p = 1000 
r = 5    
t = 2    

si = (p * r * t) / 100
print(f"The Simple Interest is: {si}")

3) Largest of Three

x, y, z = 15, 25, 10

if x >= y and x >= z:
    largest = x
elif y >= x and y >= z:
    largest = y
else:
    largest = z

print(f"The biggest number is {largest}")

4) Checking Leap Year 

year = 2024

if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) 
    print(f"{year} is a Leap Year!")
else:
    print(f"{year} is not a Leap Year.")


5) Checking Palindrome Word

text = "naman"

if text == text[::-1]:
    print("Yes, it is a palindrome")
else:
    print("No, it is not")


6) Calculating Factorial 

a = 5
b = 1

for i in range(1, a + 1):
    b = b * i

print(f"The factorial of {a} is {b}")

7) List questions

number = [10, 55, 2, 89, 43, 67, 12, 90, 5, 31]

total = sum(numbers)

big_numbers = []
for n in numbers:
    if n > 50:
        big_numbers.append(n)

print(f"Total: {total}")
print(f"Numbers > 50: {big_numbers}")
